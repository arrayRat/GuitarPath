    <p class="lead">Before we start playing, this short lesson will help to build a solid general foundation for your musical journey.</p>
  
    <p>Guitar is a uniquely <u>visual</u> and auditory instrument. You’ll learn patterns by seeing <u>shapes</u> on the fretboard and hearing how they connect. That dual nature is powerful — and we’ll lean into it every step of the way.</p>

  <h2>0.1 — Guitar Mindset: Why the Guitar is Unique</h2>

  <p>The guitar is one of the most visual instruments in music. Unlike the piano — where every chord shape is unique — the guitar lets you use the same <strong>movable shapes</strong> up and down the neck to create chords in any key.</p>

  <p>For example, here’s an E major chord (a triad made of the notes <strong>E, G♯, and B</strong>):</p>

  <!-- Insert E major chord diagram here -->
  <img src="../src/imgs/E(1).png" alt="E Major Chord Diagram" class="img-fluid mb-3" />

  <p>If we move that same shape up one fret (and mute the open strings), we now have an <strong>F major</strong> chord — <strong>F, A, C</strong>. Same shape, just one fret higher:</p>

  <!-- Insert F major chord diagram here -->
  <img src="../src/imgs/F(1).png" alt="F Major Chord Diagram" class="img-fluid mb-3" />

  <p>This works because guitar is laid out like <em>six mini-pianos</em> stacked vertically. While a piano lays out notes in a straight horizontal line (like a single string), the guitar’s tuning and fret layout let you reuse patterns across keys.</p>

  <!-- Insert fretboard with highlighted E major Vs. F major -->
  <img src="../src/imgs/E - F.png" alt="E Vs. F" class="img-fluid mb-3" />

  <p>Later on (in <strong>Lesson 2: Power Chords & Moveable Shapes</strong>), we’ll go deeper into how to use this principle to your advantage — especially when playing barre chords and full scales.</p>

  <hr class="my-4">

  <h4 class="mt-4">Shapes vs. Sound</h4>
  <p>Many guitarists fixate on shapes — and while that’s powerful, it’s only half the battle. Every chord you learn has a distinct <em>emotional</em> quality. The shape helps you play it. Your <strong>ears</strong> help you internalize it.</p>

  <p>I challenge you: whenever you learn a new chord shape, don’t just memorize it — <strong>listen</strong> to it. What does E major feel like to you? Bright? Bold? Hopeful? Learning guitar is as much about <strong>training your ears</strong> as your fingers.
  Ask yourself, where does this note take me next?</p>

  <div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
    <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The guitar is a pattern-based, moveable-shape instrument. But the real power comes from combining what you <em>see</em> with what you <em>hear</em>.

  <h2>0.2 — Picking: How You Speak on the Guitar</h2>

  <p>Guitar is more than just where you put your fingers — it’s <strong>how you hit the strings</strong> that creates your voice. Your picking style shapes your tone, feel, and groove. Whether you use a pick, your fingers, or both, this is how you "speak" on the instrument.</p>

  <p>Let’s explore the two most common paths: <strong>picking</strong> with a plectrum, and <strong>fingerpicking</strong> with your hands.</p>

  <hr class="my-4">

  <h3>The Pick (Plectrum)</h3>
  <p>The pick is often where guitarists begin — and for good reason. It’s fast, clear, and powerful. From blistering metal solos to delicate country runs, the pick has shaped nearly every modern genre.</p>

  <p><strong>Notable Pick Players:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jimi Hendrix</li>
    <li>Eddie Van Halen</li>
    <li>B.B. King</li>
    <li>George Harrison</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Pros of Using a Pick:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Used in nearly every genre, from rock to country.</li>
    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Easier to isolate strings and focus on technique.</li>
    <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Produces a loud, crisp tone — great for hearing mistakes clearly.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Essential for fast runs, lead playing, and tight rhythms.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Cons of Using a Pick:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Limited dynamics:</strong> Softer expression can be harder to control.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy to lose:</strong> You will lose picks. It’s part of the journey.</li>
    <li><strong>String skipping:</strong> Jumping between non-adjacent strings takes practice.</li>
    <li><strong>Less natural in some styles:</strong> Like classical, traditional folk, or fingerstyle blues.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here’s a great video on how to hold and use a pick correctly:</p>

  <hr class="my-4">

  <h3>Fingerpicking</h3>
  <p>Fingerpicking takes things in a different direction. It’s more intimate, more expressive, and infinitely flexible. While it’s a bit more complex to learn at first, it opens up a world of tonal and textural possibilities.</p>

  <p>From classical legends to modern folk heroes, here are some artists who built entire styles from their fingertips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wes Montgomery</strong> – thumb-only jazz phrasing</li>
    <li><strong>Tommy Emmanuel</strong> – full-on acoustic wizardry</li>
    <li><strong>Elizabeth Cotten</strong> – self-taught, upside-down folk magic</li>
    <li><strong>Adrianne Lenker</strong> – expressive, indie-folk storytelling</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Pros of Fingerpicking:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dynamic control:</strong> Easily play softer or louder with subtle nuance.</li>
    <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Develops strong coordination between picking fingers.</li>
    <li><strong>Stylistic depth:</strong> Classical, jazz, blues, folk — all thrive here.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Cons of Fingerpicking:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Steeper learning curve:</strong> More fingers = more coordination required.</li>
    <li><strong>Nails or no nails?</strong> Some techniques depend on finger length or nail maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Less ideal for certain styles:</strong> Rock and punk are generally pick-based.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here’s a solid video to get started with fingerpicking technique:</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Main Takeaway:</h4>
  <p>There’s no wrong way to start. Pick one style and get playing — you can always explore the other later. What matters most is building your voice. Whether that’s with a pick, your fingers, or both, the right technique is the one that meets your goals and feels good in your hands.</p>

  <h2>0.3 — Fretting: Getting Comfortable and Clean</h2>

  <p>Good fretting technique is the foundation of clean, accurate playing. Whether you're playing chords or melodies, how you press the strings matters — and so does how you treat your hands.</p>

  <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use the very tips of your fingers</strong> — not the pads. This keeps your notes clean and prevents muting nearby strings.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your thumb behind the neck</strong>, roughly aligned with your middle finger. This gives you strength and reach.</li>
    <li><strong>Curl your fingers</strong> naturally toward the fretboard. Let them drop down, not lay flat.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintain a straight wrist</strong>. Avoid bending or twisting your wrist at uncomfortable angles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some pain in your fingertips is normal when you’re starting — you’re building calluses. But <strong>pain in your wrist or hand is not normal</strong>. Take breaks and adjust your posture if it feels off.</p>

  <h2>0.4 — Rhythm: The Most Important Skill You’ll Ever Build</h2>

  <p>Rhythm is the foundation of every great guitarist. Before you learn flashy solos or complex chords, you need to understand one thing: <strong>timing</strong>. Rhythm is what makes music feel alive — and your right hand is your metronome.</p>

  <h4>Understanding 4/4 Time</h4>
  <p>Most music you’ll hear — especially rock, pop, funk, and hip-hop — is in 4/4 time. That means each measure (or bar) has four beats, and each beat is worth a quarter note.</p>

  <p>Let’s break down the basic note and rest durations you'll encounter in 4/4:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered text-center my-4">
    <thead class="table-light">
      <tr>
        <th>Note Type</th>
        <th>Duration (Beats)</th>
        <th>Counting</th>
        <th>Rest Symbol</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Whole Note</strong> (𝅝)</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>𝄻</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Half Note</strong> (𝅗𝅥)</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1, 3</td>
        <td>𝄼</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Quarter Note</strong> (♩)</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1 2 3 4</td>
        <td>𝄽</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Eighth Note</strong> (♪)</td>
        <td>1/2</td>
        <td>1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &</td>
        <td>𝄾</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Sixteenth Note</strong> (𝅘𝅥𝅯)</td>
        <td>1/4</td>
        <td>1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a</td>
        <td>𝄿</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>As you can see, the more you divide the beat, the faster the rhythm. Each note has a matching rest — silence is just as important as sound when it comes to groove.</p>

  <h4>Use a Metronome — Always</h4>
  <p>A metronome keeps steady time and teaches you to play in sync with the beat. Start slow, and increase speed only once you're locked in.</p>

  <p><strong>Try one of these free metronomes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.soundbrenner.com/" target="_blank">Soundbrenner</a> (iOS/Android)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.proguitartuner.com/metronome/" target="_blank">ProGuitar Metronome (Web)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/tools/metronome" target="_blank">Justin Guitar Metronome</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Think in Beats, Not Patterns</h4>
  <p>Strumming patterns are useful, but they’re just surface-level shortcuts. The real goal is to understand how your hand relates to the beat. You strum on beats, play between them, or leave space with rests. This is how pros "comp" — rhythmically supporting a song with feel, not formulas.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJIbf4nMG3Y" title="How to Fret Notes Cleanly on Guitar" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <h4>Right-Hand Rhythm Exercise (Muted Strings with Counting)</h4>
  <p>This drill helps you internalize timing. You’ll mute the strings and focus only on your strumming hand and the beat.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Lightly rest your fretting hand on all six strings to mute them.</li>
    <li>Set your metronome to 60 BPM.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 1 – Quarter Notes:</strong> Strum down on every beat.<br><strong>Count:</strong> 1 2 3 4</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2 – Eighth Notes:</strong> Strum down-up on each beat.<br><strong>Count:</strong> 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3 – Sixteenth Notes (challenge):</strong> Down-up-down-up evenly across each beat.<br><strong>Count:</strong> 1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a</li>
    <li><strong>Level 4 – Rest Integration:</strong> Try patterns like: Down – Rest – Down-Up – Rest. Always keep your hand moving in time.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Bonus: Dynamic Control</h4>
  <p>Once you feel confident keeping time, try adding <strong>dynamics</strong> — playing at different volumes while staying perfectly in rhythm. This builds control and musical awareness.</p>

  <p><strong>Try this variation:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Set your metronome to 60 BPM.</li>
    <li>Strum muted strings using quarter notes (1 2 3 4).</li>
    <li>Alternate between loud and soft strums:<br>
      <code>LOUD — soft — LOUD — soft</code>
    </li>
    <li>Try full patterns like: <br>
      <code>soft — soft — LOUD — soft</code> or <code>LOUD — LOUD — soft — soft</code></li>
  </ol>

<p>The challenge is to <strong>stay in perfect time</strong> no matter how hard or gently you play. This is where groove and expression really start to come alive.</p>


  <p>The goal here isn't musicality — it's control. This is your internal clock workout.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
    <strong>Main Takeaway:</strong> Master rhythm by understanding beat division, listening to the space between notes, and training your right hand to move with purpose — not just patterns.
